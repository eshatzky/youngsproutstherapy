        We understand that every child is unique, which is why we use a
        combination of therapeutic modalities to create a personalized plan.
        Whether your child benefits from traditional talk therapy, play therapy,
        or art therapy, we will tailor our approach to best meet their needs.
        Our therapists also work closely with parents to ensure that progress
        made in therapy is supported at home.
