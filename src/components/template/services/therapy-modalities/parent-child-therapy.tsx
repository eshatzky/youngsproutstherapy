Through a series of interactive coaching sessions, parents are guided by a therapist to improve their communication, discipline strategies, and overall relationship with their child. PCIT is particularly effective for children aged 2 to 7 who exhibit behavioral issues such as aggression, defiance, and tantrums. Our Young Sprouts Therapy team specializes in providing PCIT for families looking to resolve these challenges and foster a positive family dynamic. We offer in-person sessions in Vaughan and Thornhill, as well as virtual parent coaching for your convenience.",
